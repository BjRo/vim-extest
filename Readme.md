# extest.vim

`extest.vim` is a [vim](http://www.vim.org) plugin, which helps you to run tests written in the [elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/) language from inside vim.
Currently it supports elixirs native test framework exunit as well as [Amitra](https://github.com/josephwilk/amrita).

## Installation

If you don't have a preferred installation method, I recommend
installing [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen), and
then simply copy and paste:

```console
cd ~/.vim/bundle
git clone git://github.com/bjro/vim-extest.git
```

## Key Bindings
By default extest.vim doesn't bind to any keys but is available in the form of commands

* `:ExTestRunFile` runs all the tests in the file that is loaded into the current buffer
* `:ExTestRunTest` runs the test case under the cursor
* `:ExTestRunLast` runs the last test, from any buffer

If you want to bind those commands to your leader keys, you can do so nevertheless. For example:

```vim
map <leader>T :ExTestRunFile<CR>
map <leader>t :ExTestRunMethod<CR>
map <leader>lt :ExTestRunLast<CR>
```

## Customizing
You can customize the command which will be used to run each test by setting these options in your `.vimrc` file:

```vim
let g:extest_exunit_run_file_cmd = "mix test '%f'"
let g:extest_exunit_run_test_cmd = "mix test '%f'"
let g:extest_amrita_run_file_cmd = "mix amrita '%f'"
let g:extest_amrita_run_test_cmd = "mix amrita '%f:%l'"
```

Placeholders:

* `%f`: path of test file
* `%l`: line number

## Kudos
This plugin has been heavily influenced and inspired by [rubytest.vim](https://github.com/janx/vim-rubytest) by [janx](https://github.com/janx).
I've used it daily when developing stuff in Ruby in the last 2 years and wouldn't want to miss it. It's awesome. Go check it out!
